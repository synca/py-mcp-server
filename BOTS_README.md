# Context

This repository contains Python tools that use MCP (Model Context Protocol). These tools provide functionality for linting, testing, and type checking Python code, including tools like `flake8`, `pytest`, and `mypy`.

The MCP components in this repository are designed to integrate with these standard Python tools to enhance their functionality within the MCP ecosystem.

# Rules

* MUST NOT add trailing whitespace in any of these files
* MUST NOT write any scripts or other unwanted cruft unless specifically asked to
* SHOULD check the code base with the tools if they are available
* MUST end all files with a newline
* MUST NOT add unnecessary typing imports and should instead use modern typing hints
* SHOULD move any files to a directory called waste if you want to delete them
